## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from requirement categories (Foundation, Core Reads, Write Tools, Integration)
- Roadmap: Kanban, templates, journal, DataScript query tools, and additional writes deferred to v2
- [Phase 01-foundation]: model_validator(mode='before') coerces int to {id: N} for BlockRef/PageRef to handle Logseq API polymorphic response format
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Compact children [['uuid', 'val']] dropped silently (set to []) since compact format from getBlock is not useful for MCP consumers
- [Phase 01-foundation]: pytest.importorskip used for stub test modules — whole module skips cleanly without noise until target module is implemented

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
